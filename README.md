# OncoTV
Angular App helping you choose a movie for tonight !

App using AngularJS v1.6.4 and SCSS to display a TV Shows library and details about movies.

Just clone the depository and run "npm install" to load node modules.

Once it's done and you're ready to code, run "gulp" to compile SCSS files and run a server on localhost:8888.

Enjoy !
