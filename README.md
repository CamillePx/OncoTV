Angular App helping you choose a movie for tonight !

This branche is quite the same as the master one, except it's working with an movies API.
This induces that there are 20 movies available, the best one at the moment as this list is constantly updated.

The only problems with this solution is that the API doesn't provide a trailer URL neither an retina poster source.

There is one difference more as this version is built with two differents views/templates. This seemed more logical/right to me but doesn't allow to have smooth transition between states...

As for the master branche, just download/clone the projet, run "npm install" to load node modules and then "gulp" to launch server and compile SCSS files
